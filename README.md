# **TOS** or *Temporary Overlays*
Designed by Baekoor for anyone for any reason

1. Main goal of which is to allow users to select png's to upload which will be saved and can be displayed and dropped easily anywhere
2. Should follow up with support to decide on which layer to display their image with windows covering
3. Possily add support for gif's if there are gif png's (I think?)
